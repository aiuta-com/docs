# Complete interaction sequences

The detailed sequence diagrams below cover all stages of interaction with the Aiuta SDK. The diagrams help visualize the flow of operations, such as initialization and the try-on process, highlighting the roles of the user, your app, backend services, Aiuta SDK and API. Authentication of requests from the SDK to the Aiuta API/Backend based on the configuration provided is described [here](/sdk/about/diagrams/authentication/).

## Initialization

The next diagram illustrates the initialization process from launching the app to displaying products, including configuration and model requests.

``` mermaid

    {% include-markdown "sdk/templates/about/common-sd-participants.md" %}

    USR->>APP: Launch the App
    APP->>SDK: Initialize with Configuration

    activate SDK
    Note over APP,SDK: Includes auth, UI, features, analytics
    SDK->>API: Request internal configuration
    API-->>SDK: Internal configuration
    opt predefined models feature
        SDK->>API: Request predefined models
        API-->>SDK: Predefined models collection
    end
    deactivate SDK

    APP->>BE: Load products
    BE-->>APP: Products
    Note over APP,BE: Including a flag whether<br>a virtual try-on is available

    APP-->>USR: Show products
    Note over APP,USR: Including a try-on button for<br>products with try-on feature

    Please note in <span class="md-sequence-number">8 â€“ 9</span> that you should obtain information about the availability of the virtual try-on feature for each of your products from __your__ backend, as the SDK does not receive information about product availability and will attempt to launch a virtual try-on with any product you provide, which may result in an error if that product has not been trained by Aiuta.

## Try-On
