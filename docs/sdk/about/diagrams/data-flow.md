# Data flow

Overview sequence diagram covers the handling of user data. It shows a simplified process from obtaining user consent to uploading and displaying images, highlighting the roles of the user, your app, backend services, Aiuta SDK and API. You can view also [the complete interaction sequence](/sdk/about/diagrams/interaction-sequence/) diagrams.

!!! info "Anonymous photos" 
    We do not process any user data other than photos, do not request your user IDs, and all uploaded images remain anonymous to us

```

!!! info "Access tokens"
    Depending on the storage type and access levels set, the URL in the Aiuta API response <span class="md-sequence-number">8</span> may contain a temporary access token so that the SDK has time to download the results and <span class="md-sequence-number">10</span> show them to the user before access to that URL is expired. For further use <span class="md-sequence-number">9</span> under the control of your app and to provide historical data for display in the SDK when using data providers ([uploaded](/sdk/about/developer/configuration/#uploads-history) and [generated](/sdk/about/developer/configuration/#generations-history)), your application must ensure access by refreshing the tokens in the URL.
