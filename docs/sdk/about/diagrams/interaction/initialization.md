    Please note in <span class="md-sequence-number">8 â€“ 9</span> that you should obtain information about the availability of the virtual try-on feature for each of your products from __your__ backend, as the SDK does not receive information about product availability and will attempt to launch a virtual try-on with any product you provide, which may result in an error if that product has not been trained by Aiuta.
