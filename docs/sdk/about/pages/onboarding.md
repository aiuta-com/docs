# Onboarding

![How It Works](/media/pages/how-it-works-1.png){ width=300 }

The Onboarding feature guides users through the SDK's functionality, helping them understand how to use the virtual try-on experience effectively.

## When to Use

- Show onboarding when users first interact with the SDK
- Use it to explain the virtual try-on process

!!! info "Behavior"
    The Onboarding is displayed repeatedly until the user completes it.<br>
    After completion, it won't be shown again unless the completion status reset.

## Data Management

The SDK provides two options for managing the onboarding completion status:

=== "Built-in"

    By default, the SDK uses platforms' local storage to store the onboarding completion status. This is the simplest approach and requires no additional configuration.

=== "Data Provider"

    You can implement your own custom data provider that:

    - Provides the `isOnboardingCompleted` status whether the user has completed the onboarding process
    - React to the `completeOnboarding` callback to mark the onboarding as completed

    !!! info "This allows you to"
        - Integrate with your existing user management system
        - Sync the status across devices
        - Reset `isOnboardingCompleted` whenever you want to show the onboarding again

    <!-- !!! question ""
        See the [How to implement](#how-to-implement) section at the bottom for information on the relevant platform. -->

## Slides

=== "How It Works (Interactive)"

    ### How It Works

    ![How It Works](/media/pages/how-it-works.png){ width=558 }

    The "How It Works" page provides an interactive demonstration of the virtual try-on feature:

    - Shows 3 example images of the same person in the same pose
    - Each example includes both the person's photo and the item preview
    - Demonstrates the transformation process

    !!! info "Default"
        By default, this is the only slide of the onboarding with embedded [terms of service](consent.md) instead of a separate consent

    ??? tip "Customization"

        #### Customization

        ##### [Images](../resources/images.md)
        - List of 3 `onboardingHowItWorksItems`, each containing:
            - Flatlay `itemPreview` image of the item for try-on with transparent background
            - Example `itemPhoto` image of the try-on result with the person wearing this item

        ##### [Text Elements](../resources/localization.md)
        - Optional `onboardingHowItWorksPageTitle`
        - `onboardingHowItWorksTitle` displayed below the interactive section
        - `onboardingHowItWorksDescription` explaining how the try-on feature works

        ##### [Typography](../resources/typography.md)
        - General `titleL` text style for the title
        - General `regular` text style for the description text

=== "Best Results (Deprecated)"

    ### Best Results

    ![Best Results](/media/pages/best-results.png){ width=300 }

    The "Best Results" page helps users achieve optimal results:

    - Shows 2 good examples and 2 bad examples of input images
    - Provides guidance on photo requirements

    !!! question "Why is it deprecated?"
        Examples of good source photos are now included into the Image Picker, so we recommend disabling this slide to avoid overwhelming the user with onboarding
