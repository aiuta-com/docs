# Loading Screen

![Loading Screen](/media/pages/loading-screen.png){width=300}

The Loading Screen is displayed during the virtual try-on process to keep users informed about the current status of their request. It shows different status messages as the system processes the image and generates the try-on result:

1. **Uploading Image** - When the user's photo is being uploaded
2. **Scanning Body** - While the system analyzes the body in the image
3. **Generating Outfit** - During the final try-on generation

## Error handling

    ### Invalid Input Image

    ![Loading Screen](../../../media/pages/loading-invalid.png){width=300}

    When the system detects that the uploaded image doesn't meet the requirements for virtual try-on (e.g., no person detected), it displays an error message with an option to try again with a different photo.

    ??? tip "Customization"

        #### Customization

        ##### [Text Elements](../resources/localization.md)
        - `invalidInputImageDescription` message for the alert

=== "Other errors"

    ### Other Errors
