# Web SDK

The Aiuta Web SDK provides a virtual try-on solution for your fashion e-commerce platform using [Aiuta Virtual Try On API](/api/try-on/index.md).

{% include-markdown "sdk/templates/intro-links.md" %}

!!! warning "Limited support"
    The Web SDK is currently under active development and only supports a small subset of configuration and styling options. [Read more here](/sdk/web/configuration/limited-support.md).

## Quick Start

```html

<script src="https://static.dev.aiuta.com/sdk/{{ latest(web) }}/index.umd.js"></script>

<script>
  var aiuta = new Aiuta(
    auth: { // (1)!
      subscriptionId: "your_subscription_id", // (2)!
      getJwt: async (params) => {
        return "JWT_from_your_backend"; // (3)!
      }
    },
    userInterface: { // (4)!
      customCssUrl: "url_to_custom_css";  // (5)!
    },
    analytics: { // (6)!
      handler: {
        onAnalyticsEvent: (event) => {
          console.log('Aiuta Event:', event); // (7)!
        }
      }
    }
  );
  
  aiuta.tryOn("your_product_id"); // (8)!
</script>
```

1. [:material-arrow-down-left: __auth__](/sdk/developer/configuration/auth.md) required to authenticate Aiuta SDK to use [API](/api/try-on/index.md) with your credentials. Supported authentication methods are `ApiKey` or `Jwt` + `subscriptionId`.

2. Should be provided for the SDK to make unsecured requests related to your account.

    !!! doc "Please see [Obtaining credentials](/api/getting-started.md#obtaining-credentials) for instructions on how to get your `subscriptionId`"

3. The implementation of this method should securely generate the JWT [on the server side](/api/server-side-auth-component.md) and subsequently return it to the SDK.

    !!! doc "Please see [`getJwt` section of JwtAuth](/sdk/developer/configuration/auth.md/#__tabbed_2_1) for more information on how it works"

4. Limited customization of user interface.

    !!! doc "Please see [details](/sdk/web/configuration/limited-support.md) for more information on currently supported configurations"

5. __Optional__ URL to the CSS file with styles configuration for the Web SDK.

    !!! doc "Please see [details](/sdk/web/configuration/custom-css.md) for more information on currently supported styles"

6. __Optional__ configuration to handle analytics events generated by the SDK.

7. Callback function that processes analytics events generated by the SDK, allowing integration with external analytics services or custom event handling. 

8. Open SDK UI to start try on flow with selected product identifier.

    !!! warning ""
        Please note that you should obtain information about the availability of the virtual try-on feature for each of your products from your backend, as the SDK does not receive information about product availability and will attempt to launch a virtual try-on with any product you provide, which may result in an error if that product has not been trained by Aiuta.
