# Aiuta Try On Overview

Aiuta Try On is a powerful feature that enables digital try-on capabilities in your application. This guide will help you get started with implementing virtual try-on functionality using the Aiuta SDK.


## Prerequisites

Before implementing Aiuta Try On, ensure you have:

- [Initialized the Aiuta SDK](../setup/installation.md)
- [Set up your development environment according to the base SDK requirements](../overview.md)


## Implementation Approaches

Aiuta Try On offers two main approaches for implementing virtual try-on functionality:

### Core Implementation
The core implementation provides direct access to try-on generation capabilities without any pre-built UI components. This approach is ideal for developers who want to:

- Build custom UI experiences
- Have full control over the try-on process
- Integrate try-on functionality into existing UI components

### UI Integration
The UI integration approach provides pre-built UI components and screens for a complete try-on experience. This approach is perfect for developers who want to:

- Quickly implement a full try-on feature
- Use Aiuta's pre-designed UI components
- Have a consistent look and feel with other Aiuta features

Choose the approach that best fits your application's needs. You can find detailed implementation guides for both approaches in the following sections.
