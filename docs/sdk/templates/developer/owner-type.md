```typescript
enum OwnerType {
    user // (1)!
    aiuta // (2)!
}
```

1.  Image uploaded or generated by the user (using a camera or from a gallery).
    
    !!! note ""
        This image belongs to the user. When the user removes the image from the history, it __may be deleted__ from the storage as well.

2.  Image of the model provided or generated by the Aiuta. 

    !!! note ""
        This image could be linked to the user history, but it is not owned by the user, and __can not be deleted__ from the storage, only unlinked from the user's history in case of removing.


Owner type primarily determines the source of origin of the image â€” whether it was generated by the user as a result of any chain of operations from upload to generation, possibly including re-generation. Alternatively, the image is not associated with the user's personal data and does not belong to them. This allows different approaches to be taken when deleting images from the history.
