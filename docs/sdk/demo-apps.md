[^1]: The iOS demo app uses unlisted distribution on the App Store, discoverable only with a direct link above.
[^2]: You can arrange with Aiuta to create a test catalog with your own products, and we will provide you with a personal access code. 
[^3]: The Android demo app currently has limited customization capabilities compared to the iOS version. For the most comprehensive demonstration of the SDK's customization features, we recommend trying the iOS demo app. However, please note that both Android and iOS SDKs provide **same customization and interaction capabilities** for your production applications.
