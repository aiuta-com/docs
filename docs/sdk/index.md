## Alternative – Direct API

If you prefer even more control over the implementation or have specific requirements, you can use the Aiuta API directly. This approach gives you complete flexibility in building your custom virtual try-on solution.

    Aiuta SDK is built on top of the same API, providing a pre-built UI layer and additional convenience features while maintaining the same core functionality.
