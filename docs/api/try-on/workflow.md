## 1. Upload an image or use predefined model

=== "Upload an image"
    Upload an image which you want to use as in input for generation. It may be some model whom you want to dress in specific clothes item.
    You will receive an object with image `id` and `url` as a result. Use image `id` on the next step to specify the `uploaded_image_id` for generation.
    
    <div class="grid" markdown>
    [Try uploading an image](/api/try-on/reference/#/default/upload_user_image_uploaded_images_post){ .card }
    </div>


=== "Use predefined model"
    Use the [list of predefined models](/api/try-on/reference/#/default/get_predefined_try_on_models_predefined_try_on_models_get) API endpoint to retrieve the available models. Each predefined modelâ€™s image has an `id`, which is used in the next step to specify the `uploaded_image_id` for generation.

## 2. Create a generation operation request
Provide `uploaded_image_id` received on the previous step as well as SKU identifiers: `sku_id` and optional `sku_catalog_name` (`"main"` by default).
You will receive an object with `operation_id` of created image generation operation in case of successful request or an error message otherwise.

</div>

## 3. Get the operation results
Use an `operation_id` from the previous step to retrieve the operation status. Operation became completed once operation status turns to `SUCCESS` or `FAILED`.
In case of successfully completed operation you will receive `generated_images` with `url` in resulting object. If an error occurred you can check error message in the `error` field.
