# API Endpoints

Use the following base URLs to make SDK or direct API calls:

## Try-On base URL

{% include-markdown "team/api/templates/endpoint-try-on.md" %}
```

Append paths like `/uploaded_images`, `/sku_images_operations`, etc.

## Analytics URL
```
{% include-markdown "team/api/templates/endpoint-analytics.md" %}
```

Append paths like `/ios-sdk-analytics`, `/android-sdk-analytics`, etc.
