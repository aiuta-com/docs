You'll need to install [Material for MKDocs :octicons-link-external-24:](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/){:target="_blank"} and some plugins:

```sh
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mkdocs-minify-plugin
pip install mkdocs-include-markdown-plugin
```

After that, in the root of your repository clone, simply run

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

In the console you will see something like
```
