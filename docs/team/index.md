# Nothing Secret

Our team uses this public documentation site and repository to build our products. It serves as a single source of truth to ensure consistent implementation across different platforms. 

## Docs

This section contains documentation conventions and maintenance tips.


## SDK
This section contains schemes and descriptions of the SDK's internal workings.
For example, besides receiving configuration from the host application (described [here](../sdk/about/developer/configuration.md)), the SDK receives configuration from the Aiuta backend. This configuration specifies the number of retries in case of failures, intervals when generation results are expected, etc.  


## So

!!! info "there is nothing confidential in this articles"
    It is simply hidden from the general navigation, so as not to overload with unnecessary information not related to the integration process. Everything described here can be found in the repositories of our open source products.

If you happen to visit these pages, don't worry and you don't need to tell us about the leak â€“ this is public on purpose.
