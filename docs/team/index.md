# Nothing Secret

Our team uses this public documentation site and repository to build our products. It serves as a single source of truth to ensure consistent implementation across different platforms. 

## Docs

This section contains documentation conventions and maintenance tips.


## SDK
This section contains schemes and descriptions of the SDK's internal workings.
For example, besides receiving configuration from the host application (described [here](../sdk/about/developer/configuration.md)), the SDK receives configuration [details](./sdk/subscription-details.md) from the Aiuta backend. This configuration specifies the number of retries in case of failures, intervals when generation results are expected, etc.
