# Nothing Secret

We within the team use this public documentation site and repo to build our products. It is a single source of truth in order to make consistent implementations on different platforms. For example, the SDK besides the configuration from the host application, which is described [here](../sdk/about/developer/configuration.md), receives some configuration from the Aiuta backend, which in particular specifies the number of retries in case of failures, the intervals when the generation results are most likely to be expected, etc. So
!!! info "there is nothing secret in this section"
    It is simply hidden from the general navigation, so as not to overload with unnecessary information not related to the integration process. Everything described here can be found in the repositories of our open source products.

If you happen to visit these pages, don't worry and you don't need to tell us about the leak - this is public on purpose.
